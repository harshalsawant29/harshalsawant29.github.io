  # About
  about:

    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/headshot.png"
    content: |-
      I've always been curious, someone who enjoys digging into details, spotting patterns, and predicting outcomes based on what’s already known. My journey began in Mechanical Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in problem-solving. During my bachelor’s, I actively participated in hackathons and tech events—an experience that revealed something important: my logical thinking and approach to solving challenges stood out. That blend of engineering logic and technical curiosity is what led me deeper into the world of data and analytics.

      With 3+ years of hands-on experience and a Master’s in Information Technology and Management from Illinois Institute of Technology, I’ve led impactful projects across different domains. I’ve mentored interns, worked directly with clients, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to solve real business problems. If something needs fixing—whether it's a broken SQL query or a process bottleneck—I’m the one who rolls up my sleeves and says, “Bring it on.”

      I value a culture of learning, collaboration, and doing work that makes a difference. I’m not just here to crunch numbers—I’m here to make them speak.
      
      Outside of work, you may find me on the soccer field, reading history books or listening to classical music.
